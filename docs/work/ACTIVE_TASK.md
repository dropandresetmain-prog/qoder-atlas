## CP2 done

- Jordan D2 arrival is `2026-09-29T15:28:00+09:00` (82 minutes before ZG053 16:50). D1 stays 95. D3 stays negative.
- PostgreSQL `a3JordanConnectionFoundation.pgtest.ts`: baseline PASS → D1 gap 95 READY → D2 gap 82 AT_RISK, not planning-eligible → D3 broken, planning-eligible. 1 PASS / 0 FAIL.
- Sarah ID7159 `2026-09-30T17:45+07→20:30+08` matches Atlas `rec_d40b625e84e68b27deab3fbb52e27c2e`. ID7153 `2026-10-01T07:45+07→10:30+08` matches Atlas `rec_b615f4f1bca688f781fe2ee3cdc39720`. Disruption event provenance remains `SIMULATED_EXTERNAL_EVENT`. Flight clock times were not moved; they were already the recorded services.
- Reviewed `jp-short-visit-sg-passport-2026-09`: SG + transit_overnight + short stay + valid passport PASSes; issuing state US FAILs. Not a hardcoded route branch.
- `test/a5-hero-seed-truth.test.ts` + `test/a5-founder-qc-progression.test.ts`: 5 PASS / 0 FAIL.
- `npm run gate:anti-hardcoding`: CLEAN (511 files).

## CP2 blocker — Act Now before CP3

Live Nuitée sandbox search for Concorde `lp21d9f`, 2026-09-29 → 2026-10-03, returned 3 rates, 0 refundable (SG, omitted nationality, and US). The checked-in baseline booking `O6vdr7G2T` is NRFN. Do not invent a free-cancellation recording. Zero cancellation penalty cannot be seeded until the sandbox offers a refundable four-night rate whose free window is still open at recovery time.

## Exact next step

Unblock the four-night free-cancellation reseed, then finish CP2 acceptance. Do not start CP3 while that penalty is still the full non-refundable price.
